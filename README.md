# 8-DOF-Quadruped-Robot/ Robotic Dog
8 DOF Quadruped Robot with Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega2560

Updates:
V3.4.0: Completed the trot system and can be control with a controller 
V3.5.0: Major updates on the trot gait planner

Currently I'm working to improve the Structure, and Program, there should be a major few more improvements in the next update.

This is a quadruped robot with 8 DOF(degrees of freedom) controlled by servo motors, I use a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 2560 as the control board for my quadruped.
