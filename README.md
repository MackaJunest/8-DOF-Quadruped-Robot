8 DOF Quadruped Robot with Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega2560

This is a quadruped robot with 8 DOF(degrees of freedom) controlled by servo motors, I use a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 2560 as the control board for my quadruped. Iâ€™m now working on it so I will update the files as soon as possible.
